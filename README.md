# Surfs_Up Analysis 

# Project Overview:
An analysis of Hawaii temperature data using SQLite, Jupyter, and Python to help determine the success of an surfing and ice-cream shop. 

## Resources:

* Data Sources:
    - SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb
    - hawaii.sqlite

* Software: SQLite, Flask, Jupyter Notebook, Python

## Results:
1. June temps are 74.9F on average with min of 64.0F and max of 85.0F.
2. December temps are 71.0F on average with min of 56.0F and max of 83.0F.
3. Annual temperature is consistent throughout the year on average with temps of low 80F.

## Summary:

* The aforementioned results demonstrate consistent temperatures throughout the year, which suggests that the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainabale year-round. It should be noted that additional queries portend that December receives a higher rate of precipitation (0.21) as compared to June (0.136). It can be expected that December may have lower sales revenue as compared to June given the inverse relationship of sales to inclement rain weather.
